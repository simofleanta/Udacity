# Udacity Data Science Bertelsmann Scholarship

In my Udacity Data Science Challenge, I was supposed to practice Python and create some data visuals using pandas data frames, with data. The aim of 
the exercise was to go through basic data types, data frames and juggling with the data so obtain a small data analysis on random data

So this ex will go through:
opening file
checking data types and making sense of the data
date timeseries parsing
one or 2 carts 
subplots 

Insights I'm looking for:

* What products sell best
* In which place Products sell best
* Possible correlations
